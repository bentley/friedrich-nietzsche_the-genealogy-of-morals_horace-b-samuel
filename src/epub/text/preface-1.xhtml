			<p>In 1887, with the view of amplifying and completing certain new doctrines which he had merely sketched in <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i> (see especially aphorism 260), Nietzsche published <i>The Genealogy of Morals</i>. This work is perhaps the least aphoristic, in form, of all Nietzsche’s productions. For analytical power, more especially in those parts where Nietzsche examines the ascetic ideal, <i>The Genealogy of Morals</i> is unequalled by any other of his works; and, in the light which it throws upon the attitude of the ecclesiast to the man of resentment and misfortune, it is one of the most valuable contributions to sacerdotal psychology.</p>
